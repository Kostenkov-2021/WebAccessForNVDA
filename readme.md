## Requirements

This is an add-on targeting the NVDA screen reader version 2016.2 or greater. 

Additionally, the following software is required in order to build this add-on:

- a Python distribution (2.7 or greater is recommended). Check the [Python Website](http://www.python.org) for Windows Installers.
- SCons - [Website](http://www.scons.org/) - version 2.1.0 or greater. Install it using **easy_install** or grab an windows installer from the website.
- GNU Gettext tools. You can find windows builds [here](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/gettext.php).
- Markdown-2.0.1 or greater, to convert documentation files to HTML documents. You can [Download Markdown-2.0.1 installer for Windows](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown/2.0.1) or get it using `pip install markdown`.


## Build

This add-on is based upon the
[addonTemplate](https://bitbucket.org/nvdaaddonteam/addontemplate)
from the NVDA Add-ons Team and, as such, is built using SCons.


Depending on your environment, your SCons command might be either `scons.py`
or `scons.bat`. As a convention, `scons` will be used within this document.


The following commands are to be run from the project root folder. 


### Generate Gettext POT translation file

`scons pot`


The resulting `WebAccess.pot` file will be created (or updated) in the project
root folder.


### Build the installation package

`scons`


The resulting `WebAccess-<version>.nvda-addon` file will be created (or
updated) in the project root folder.


### Cleaning

In order to ease in place execution during development, the manifest
and documentation files generated by the build process are stored within the
source tree, instead of a separate `build` folder.

To get rid of them:

`scons -c`



To also get rid of the generated Gettext POT translation file:

`scons -c pot`


## Install

This project follows NVDA standards regarding installation of `.nvda-addon`
files.


However, one might want to use a development version executed directly from
the source tree.

A possible solution is to use file-system junction. Run the following command
from the current user config's `addons` directory:

`mklink /J WebAccess <path to the addon folder in the source tree>

Note: Local administrator privileges are required.


In this configuration, run the following command from the same
directory to remove the junction, uninstalling the development version:

`rd WebAccess`
